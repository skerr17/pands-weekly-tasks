By Stephen Kerr

## Purpose of this Repository 
In this Repository I will submit my weekly assessments for the Module Programming & Scripting taught by [Andrew Beatty](andrew.beatty@atu.ie) for my HDIP in Computing and Data Analytics.

Throughout the semester there were weekly tasks assigned to the topics covered in the lectures. The weekly tasks are extensivly commented in and references to external / further reading is displayed throughout. 

## Technologies Used 

- Python 3.12.7 packaged by [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- Git & Github

## Table of Contenets 

- Week 1: **hellowordld.py** - Which was the intial program to test the establish environment set up.
- Week 2: **bank.py** - This program prompts the user for two Cent amounts and returns the sum amount in Euro. With additional user inout error handling.
- Week 3: **accouts.py** - This program a 10 characther long account number and output only the last 4 digitls showing the first 6 as "X's". Also outlines assumptions where applicable and user input validation (must be an alphanumeric). 
- Week 4: **collatz.py** - This program sks the user to input any positive interger and outputs the successive values of the following calculations if even divide by 2, if odd multiply by three and add one. The program ends when the current value is 1.
- Week 5: **weekday.py** - This program outputs weather or not today is a weekday. 
- Week 6: **squareroot.py** - This program takes a positive floating-point number as an input and outputs an approximation of its square root. Using Newton Method of estimating square roots. With user input validation.
- Week 7: **es.py** - This program reads in a txt file (**mobydick.py**) and counts the number of a certain letter in it. Including user input error handling.
- Week 8: - This program displays a normal distriution of numbers as a histogram with a plot fuction of $h(x)=x^3 where x = 1-10$. Saving the histogram to **normal_dist_and_hx.png**.
